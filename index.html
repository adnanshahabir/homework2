    <h2> Learning How To Perform Marketing Research For Free </h2>
    <p> I’ve said it time and time again, the single most important aspect of an affiliate marketing business is the research phase. Ironically, this is also the most overlooked aspect of affiliate marketing.

        Think of it this way – if you were about to open a restaurant, wouldn’t you do some research before quitting your day job and investing hundreds of thousands of dollars into it? Of course you would! You would research the best location, the best type of food to serve, how much you’ll have to pay employees, where you’ll source ingredients from, what type of tables and furniture to use, the best ovens and equipment for the kitchen, and all sorts of stuff. If you just “wing it” and open a restaurant without doing any research first, you’ll most likely fail. While affiliate marketing can be started part-time and without much capital, the same holds true. If you don’t research and plan, you will fail.
        
        I think there are a couple main reasons why the research aspect is so overlooked in affiliate marketing. The first reason is, people are just lazy. Most new affiliate marketers are only thinking about making money in the shortest period of time, so they simply choose a niche and build a site in their first day. Then, months go by with little to no website traffic and they proclaim that affiliate marketing no longer works. Considering affiliate marketing is a multi-billion dollar per year industry driving about 20% of all online sales, that of course isn’t true. Most people just don’t do the research necessary to truly find a profitable niche that is in demand without too much competition.
        
        The second reason I think many affiliate marketers skip the research phase is because they simply don’t know HOW or WHAT to research. They may see the importance of proper market research, but simply don’t know the right way to go about it.
        
        Well fear not! If you created your free account that I told you to sign up for, you can check out this page and get everything you need to properly research an industry that will end up making you piles of money (because you planned ahead!).
        
        It would be nice if we could create websites about whatever niche we wanted, and that’s fine if you don’t care about money, but if you actually want to earn an income from your affiliate marketing efforts, you need to know for sure that your niche is profitable and winnable (enough demand but not too much competition). Trust me, there is a niche for you. Go out there, do some research, and find it. These videos will show you exactly how to do that, step-by-step.</p>
